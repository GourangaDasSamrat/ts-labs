# ts-labs 🚀

Personal TypeScript practice repository — a collection of small labs, exercises, and experiments I  work on while learning and exploring TypeScript. 💡

About
-----
- Purpose: Practice TypeScript concepts, try out ideas, and keep short, focused experiments. 🧪
- Style: Labs are usually small and self-contained. Each lab may include a short README describing its goal. 📘
- Intent: This is a learning playground — expect experiments, notes, and incremental improvements. 🔧


Happy coding!
